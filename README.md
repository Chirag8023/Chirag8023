Security Researcher from India

Computer Science (2021-24)

Been using computers since I was 5 - love repairing things (big fan of iFixit toolkits).

Currently getting into web security and Linux (yes, i use Kali Linux).

Got tired of virtual events, would love to attend DEFCON. (want to sponsor me? let's talk!)

Probably playing Skyrim or Fallout right now.
